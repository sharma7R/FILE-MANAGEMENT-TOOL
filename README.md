Write Data to a File – The program creates a new file (or overwrites an existing one) and writes user-provided content to it.

Read Data from a File – It opens an existing text file and displays its contents on the screen.

Append Data to a File – The program adds new content to an existing file without erasing its previous data.
Key Concepts Used:

* ofstream (Output File Stream): Used for writing data to a file.

* ifstream (Input File Stream): Used for reading data from a file.

* fstream (File Stream): Used for both reading and writing operations.

Features of the Application:

* User-friendly menu for selecting operations (Read, Write, Append).

* Error handling for file operations (e.g., checking if a file exists before reading).

* Continuous execution until the user chooses to exit.
